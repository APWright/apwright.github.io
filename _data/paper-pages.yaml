    With the recent release of AI interaction guidelines from Apple, Google, and Microsoft, there is clearly interest in understanding the best practices in human-AI interaction. However, industry standards are not determined by a single company, but rather by the synthesis of knowledge from the whole community. We have surveyed all of the design guidelines from each of these major companies and developed a single, unified structure of guidelines, giving developers a centralized reference. We have then used this framework to compare each of the surveyed companies to find differences in areas of emphasis. Finally, we encourage people to contribute additional guidelines from other companies, academia, or individuals, to provide an open and extensible reference of AI design guidelines at [https://ai-open-guidelines.readthedocs.io/](https://ai-open-guidelines.readthedocs.io/).

    A: RECAST consists of a textbox and a radial progress bar. A color change on the radial progress, along with a score, indicate the toxicity of a sentence. Toxicity ranges from white (non-toxic) to red (very toxic). Users can hover over options to preview toxicity scores for replacing the selected word in the sentence. B: upon replacing the word (in the case of this figure, replacing “idiotic” with “nonsensical”), the main radial progress bar reflects the reduced toxicity score. However the small attention on the other pejorative word "moron" compared to "video" in the alternative version shows the idiosyncrasies of the model and underlying dataset.

    As toxic language becomes nearly pervasive online, there has been increasing interest in leveraging the advancements in natural language processing (NLP) to automatically detect and remove toxic comments. Despite fairness concerns and limited interpretability, there is currently little work for auditing these systems in particular for end users. We present our ongoing work, RECAST, an interactive tool for auditing toxicity detection models by visualizing explanations for predictions and providing alternative wordings for detected toxic speech. RECAST displays the attention of toxicity detection models on user input, and provides an intuitive system for rewording impactful language within a comment with less toxic alternative words close in embedding space. Finally we propose a larger user study  of RECAST, with promising preliminary results, to validate it's effectiveness and useability with end users.

    An illustrative multiplex network of proliferation-relevant determinants, with layers from top to bottom showing the NCAs, alliances, conflict, and trade relationships between nodes. Panel a shows a schematic network representation, where the nodes represent states. These nodes participate in all network layers, but the relationships between nodes (edges) are unique in each layer based on the relevant interstate relations. Panel b shows the full network representation of the model for the year 1980, built using open-source data.

    States facing the decision to develop a nuclear weapons program do so within a broader context of their relationships with other countries. How these diplomatic, economic, and strategic relationships impact proliferation decisions, however, remains under-specified. Adding to the existing empirical literature that attempts to model state proliferation decisions, this article introduces the first quantitative heterogeneous network analysis of how networks of conflict, alliances, trade, and nuclear cooperation interact to spur or deter nuclear proliferation. Using a multiplex network model, we conceptualize states as nodes linked by different modes of interaction represented on individual network layers. Node strength is used to quantify factors correlated with nuclear proliferation and these are combined in a weighted sum across layers to provide a metric characterizing the proliferation behavior of the state. This multiplex network modeling approach provides a means for identifying states with the highest relative likelihood of proliferation—based only on their relationships to other states. This work demonstrates that latent conflict and nuclear cooperation are positively correlated with proliferation, while an increased trade dependence suggests a decreased proliferation likelihood. A case study on Iran’s controversial nuclear program and past nuclear activity is also provided. These findings have clear, policy-relevant conclusions related to alliance posture, sanctions policy, and nuclear assistance.

    The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) must ensure the peaceful use of all nuclear materials with a budget that has been compared in size to that of the police department in Vienna. This includes, for example, coverage of nearly 1,300 nuclear facilities spread around the globe and verification of over 200,000 significant quantities of nuclear material. The amount of information the IAEA collects is on an upward trajectory, and data overload is poised to be an ever- increasing stress on the IAEA’s ability to perform its safeguards mission. Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) has been investing over the past several years in experimental studies within a number of its unique facilities to characterize activity patterns and operational modes using automated methods for disparate data integration. Building on the success of these preliminary studies, there is currently an effort funded by the Laboratory-Directed Research and Development (LDRD) Program at Los Alamos to develop a testbed at one of the laboratory’s radiological facilities for advancing this work, specifically aimed at safeguards-relevant data streams. The overarching goal of this work is to develop and experimentally validate methods to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of safeguards verification at nuclear facilities, which will allow the IAEA to better utilize the data it is already collecting. The paper describes work that has been completed to date as well as implications for future areas of research.
