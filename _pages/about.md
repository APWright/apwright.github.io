Every day machine learning and AI become more central in our lives and reap huge dividends for large private companies. However, many public entities such as national laboratories, federal agencies, and local governments have not yet been able to fully utilize these technologies. This is because  ML techniques face a number of human centered challenges:  a lack of usability and accessibility for subject matter experts, uninterpretable models preventing transparency of automated decisions, and biases in data leading to unacceptable injustices. My research agenda in Civic AI aims to solve these problems intersecting machine learning, human-computer interaction, and public policy, and aims to actualize the potential of these technologies with usability, interpretability, and fairness.
